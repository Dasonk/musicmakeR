{"name":"Musicmaker","tagline":"A package for R which provides tools that make creating simple songs through the use of sine waves much easier.","body":"musicmakeR\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThe `musicmakeR` package  provides an easy way to create music from within R. \r\nCurrently only simple sine waves are used but chords can be created quite\r\neasily as well.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nCurrently there isn't a release on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/).\r\n\r\nYou can, however, download the [zip ball](https://github.com/Dasonk/musicmakeR/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/Dasonk/musicmakeR/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **devtools** package to install the development version:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n## Make sure your current packages are up to date\r\nupdate.packages()\r\n## devtools is required\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"musicmakeR\", \"Dasonk\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Windows users need [Rtools](http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/) and [devtools](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) to install this way.\r\n\r\n## Using musicmakeR\r\n\r\nOnce you have `musicmakeR` installed if you want to test whether it works on your system you can try the following\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(musicmakeR)\r\n\r\n# odetojoy is a built in vector containing the notes/chords\r\n# to play Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'.  For more information see ?odetojoy\r\nodetojoy.song <- makesong(odetojoy, baseduration = 1/4)\r\n\r\n# Play the song\r\nplaysong(odetojoy.song)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf that plays \"Ode to Joy\" for you then you're all set and you can try to make your own music if you would like\r\n\r\n```r\r\nmynotes <- c(\"A5\", \"B5\", \"C5\")\r\nmysong <- makesong(mynotes)\r\nplaysong(mysong)\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
